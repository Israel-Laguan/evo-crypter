# Security Considerations for evo-crypter

While `evo-crypter` is an interesting project for exploring encryption concepts, it's important to understand its security limitations and use it responsibly.

## Current Limitations

*   **Experimental Nature:** `evo-crypter` is primarily an educational and experimental tool. It has not undergone rigorous security analysis and should not be used to protect highly sensitive data in real-world scenarios.
*   **Simple Mutations:** The default mutation functions provided in the current version are relatively simple and may not offer strong cryptographic security.
*   **Generation Sequence Security:** The security of the encryption heavily relies on keeping the generation sequence secret. If an attacker obtains the generation sequence, they can easily decrypt the data.
*   **No Key Management:** The project does not currently implement robust key management practices.

## Recommendations

*   **Don't Use for Sensitive Data:** Do not rely on `evo-crypter` to encrypt highly sensitive or critical data. Use established and well-vetted cryptographic libraries for such purposes.
*   **Don't Commit Secrets:** Never commit sensitive information like encryption keys or custom mutation functions to a public code repository.
*   **Strong Mutations:** If you intend to experiment with improving the security of `evo-crypter`, focus on designing and implementing strong, cryptographically secure mutation functions.
*   **Key Management:** Explore ways to incorporate proper key management techniques, such as deriving keys from passwords using strong key derivation functions (KDFs) like Argon2 or scrypt.
*   **Authenticated Encryption:** Consider adding support for authenticated encryption to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering.
*   **Security Audit:** If you plan to use `evo-crypter` in a more serious context, consider conducting a thorough security audit to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Future Security Enhancements

The roadmap for `evo-crypter` includes plans for several security enhancements:

*   **Stronger Mutation Functions:** Implementing more robust and cryptographically sound mutation functions.
*   **Dynamic Loading of Mutations:** Allowing users to load custom mutation functions from shared libraries, potentially enabling the use of established cryptographic primitives.
*   **Feedback Mechanism (Fitness Function):** Introducing a feedback mechanism to guide the evolutionary process towards stronger encryption.
*   **Key Management:** Incorporating proper key derivation and management.
*   **Authenticated Encryption:** Adding support for authenticated encryption schemes.
*   **Security Audit:** Conducting a professional security audit to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

**Disclaimer:** The developers of `evo-crypter` are not responsible for any misuse of this software or any security breaches that may result from using it to protect sensitive data. Use it at your own risk and only for educational or experimental purposes.
